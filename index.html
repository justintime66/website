<h4>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages the exploration and development of the nation's offshore resources. It seeks to appropriately balance economic development, energy independence, and environmental protection through oil and gas leases, renewable energy development and environmental reviews and studies.The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is responsible for monitoring mineral resource exploration and development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in accordance with the OCS Lands Act. The Office of Resource Evaluation manages programs involving the collection and interpretation of geological, geophysical, and engineering data utilized in estimation quantities of discovered and undiscovered mineral resources within the OCS to assure receipt of fair market value of tracts offered to private industry for lease. They use Geoframe IESX interpretation software tointerpret and edit horizons, fault cuts, fault contacts, fault traces and fault boundaries. They do 2d, 3d and 4d models along with real operations and interpretaion tools to help the oilfield operate at its maximum capacity while upholding the green energy regulations. My goal is to learn all I can about what changes and regulations the oilfield has in regard to our land Management. For instance the land bid in New Mexico in 2018 that grossed almost a billion dollars, breaking all records.</h4>
