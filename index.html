<h3>The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Replaced the Mineral Management Service(MMS) after some controversy involving BP.
   The new ofice claims to manage the exploration and development of the nation's offshore resources. It seeks to appropriately balance economic development.sible for monitoring mineral resource exploration and development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in accordance with the OCS Lands Act. The Office of Resource Evaluation manages programs involving the collection and interpretation of geological, geophysical, and engineering data utilized in estimation quantities of discovered and undiscovered mineral resources within the OCS to assure receipt of fair market value of tracts offered to private industry for lease. They use Geoframe IESX interpretation software tointerpret and edit horizons, fault cuts, fault contacts, fault traces and fault boundaries. My goal is to learn all I can about what changes and regulations the oilfield has in regard to our land Management. For instance the land bid in New Mexico in 2018 that grossed almost a billion dollars, breaking all records. In 2017 nearly 27 million acres of federal land were leased to oil and gas developers, but less then 50% of the 26 million acres were producing any oil or gas. So why do we keep leasing federal land? Some public land advocates and lawmakers have suggested there might exist a more perverse incentive for companies to sit on undeveloped federal land. A company acquires a lease, it then carries those subsurface reserves as assets on its balance sheet. By doing this, a company can immediately improve its overall financial health, boost its attractiveness to shareholders and investors, and even increase its ability to borrow on favorable terms. Because of this, companies have the potential to directly benefit from amassing these undeveloped reserves through federal land leases, while the U.S. taxpayer loses out on revenue that could—and should—be generated from wells actually producing oil and gas products. Overall oil and gas companies do acquire federal leases with the purpose of increasing their booked reserves and bolstering their overall financial health. Rather then produce oil and gas making the share holders money they seem to me gearing towards land development. A memorandum from the Interior Department, made public Thursday, directs its field offices “to simplify and streamline the leasing process” so that federal leases to the oil and gas industry can be expedited “to ensure quarterly oil and gas lease sales are consistently held.” The new approach requires the Bureau of Land Management to process a proposed lease within six months. Once-mandatory public participation in safety reviews is now left to the discretion of the agency’s field representatives. Public protests of finalized leases will be shortened to 10 days, and a sale can move forward even if disputes are unresolved, according to the memo.</h3>
